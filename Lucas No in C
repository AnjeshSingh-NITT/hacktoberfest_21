The Lucas numbers or Lucas series are an integer sequence named after the mathematician François Édouard Anatole Lucas (1842–91), 
who studied both that sequence and the closely related Fibonacci numbers.
Similar to the Fibonacci numbers, each Lucas number is defined to be the sum of its two immediately previous terms.
However, unlike the Fibonacci numbers, which start as 1, 2, ...,1,2,..., Lucas numbers start as 2, 1, ...2,1,...


#include <stdio.h>

  	  n0=0;
  	  n1=2;
  	  n2=1;
      printf("%d %d %d",n0,n1,n2);
     // printf()
    for(c=0;c<10;c++)
      {
      	thirdterm=n2+n1;
      	n1=n2;
      	n2=thirdterm;
  	  printf(" %d ",thirdterm); 
      }
  }
